How to edit it | 
All pretty self explanatory. Looks through style.css to edit colours and index.html to edit Links and Icons. To add a custom PFP and background make a folder in the main directory called "images". 
Then select your background and PFP and drag them in the images folder. Rename the pfp to pfp.png and background to background.pfp.
